# pgFMU
An extension for traditional DBMS to work with model simulation, validation and calibration.

pgFMU is a solution for data analysts that need to work with both data and FMU-based simulation models in a single model- and data management environment. pgFMU facilitates user interaction with FMI-based model storage, model simulation, and parameter estimation tasks inside an SQL-based environment. For this purpose, pgFMU offers a number of convenient User Defined Functions (UDFs) accessible by simple SQL queries for each necessary operation.

Installation

pgFMU relies on a number of third-party software.

Prerequisites:
A Linux-based distribution, with Kernel 3.19 or higher (test on Ubuntu 14.04-16.04), with superuser permissions
